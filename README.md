Hi, everyone!
I'm Federico, I'm 16 y.o. and I came from Italy.
I'm a student in a tecnical istitute.
I'm learning programming because i'm going to become a software developer or a Data scientist.
I know a little byte about Python and C++.
I plan to use GitHub to learn how to code and give my contribute to an open source project!
